# build-pytorch-scatter

Pre-built Linux wheels for [PyTorch Scatter](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_scatter), across
Python, PyTorch, CUDA, and CPU architectures.

## Installation

Following the PyTorch convention, artifacts are published to a separate index for each CUDA
version, with CPU-only wheels on the CPU index. Each wheel has a local version suffix that
identifies the accelerator and PyTorch versions it was built against, such as
`torch-scatter==2.1.2+cu.12.8.torch.2.10`, and requires the matching PyTorch release.

Pre-built wheels are available on [Astral's GPU indexes](https://wheels.astralshosted.com/index.html).
For example, to install a CUDA 12.8 build:

```console
$ uv add torch-scatter --index astral-cu128=https://wheels.astralshosted.com/simple/cu128/
```

This configures the index and uses it as the source for `torch-scatter`:

```toml
[tool.uv.sources]
torch-scatter = { index = "astral-cu128" }

[[tool.uv.index]]
name = "astral-cu128"
url = "https://wheels.astralshosted.com/simple/cu128/"
```

Or, with `uv pip`:

```console
$ uv pip install --index https://wheels.astralshosted.com/simple/cu128/ torch-scatter
```

For a CPU-only build, use the `https://wheels.astralshosted.com/simple/cpu/`
index instead.

## Supported versions

Wheels are available for the following `torch-scatter` versions:
